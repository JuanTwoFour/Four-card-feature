### Built with

- Flex-box
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font styles

### What I learned

This project I learned a much simpler way of centering my HTML on any screen size, previously I was over complicating it by adding margins and paddings to my media queries. This is a much faster and simpler way to get the page to center perfectly.

```css
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
}

html {
  display: table;
  margin: auto;
}

body {
  display: table-cell;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```
